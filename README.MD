# This is a Spigot plugin that is inspired from the Skrip I've made in the past.
The objective was to remake the Skript into a Spigot plugin because I havn't made a Spigot plugin in a while and I wanted to see if I could do it.

## Features
- Homes (Sethome and Home)
- Hub
- Invsee (Allows admins to see the inventory of a player)
- Enderchest (Allows players to access their enderchest + Admins can access any player's enderchest)
- Broadcast (Broadcasts a message to all players or send a title to a player)

- Factions (Create a faction, invite players, kick players, claim land, etc.).
    - Faction command isn't finished yet.
